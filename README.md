This website serves as both a personal website and as a demo for my skills as a web developer. Please take a look around to get an idea of how I write code.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React - My current frontend framework of choice. Pairs well with TypeScript
- Styled Components - My current favorite CSS-in-JS framework
- TypeScript - My favorite way to write JavaScript. Types greatly improve the readability and refactorability of my code
